## Buck Converter Design
Before reading this section, please read the [Introduction](http://www.simonbramble.co.uk/dc_dc_converter_design/dc_dc_converter_design.htm).

All of the circuits in this tutorial can be simulated in LTspiceÂ®. If you are new to LTspice, please have a look at my LTspice Tutorial

In order to efficiently reduce a high voltage to a lower voltage, a buck dc/dc converter is needed.

Consider the circuit of FIG 1
